# Evolution Music - Generating Music with Genetic Algorithms

## Introduction
Evolution Music is a project that uses genetic algorithms to evolve MIDI-based music compositions. By treating musical notes as a population, the algorithm applies selection, mutation, and crossover operations to gradually improve the generated music. The goal is to produce musically pleasing compositions through evolutionary processes.

## Features
- Genetic Algorithm-Based Music Generation: Uses selection, mutation, and crossover to evolve MIDI sequences.
- MIDI Note Encoding: Stores and manipulates MIDI notes using a compact integer representation.
- Automated Fitness Evaluation: Determines the quality of music based on predefined rules.
- MIDI Output Generation: Converts evolved sequences into MIDI files for playback.
